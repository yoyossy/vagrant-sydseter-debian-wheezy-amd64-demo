###Description
Ruby git services for integrating git into systems built in ruby.
Currently there is only 1 script available. The script parses a yaml file and clones the git repositories added there into the src directory stated in the yaml.
The service hasn't been modeled very well so if I where you, I would rewrite it into a proper module with object oriented domain driven design.
