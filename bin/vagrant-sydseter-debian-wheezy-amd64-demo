# This scipt wraps the vagrant command for the 
# vagrant-debian-wheezy-amd64-puppet box.
# It changes directory to this package's install dir and issues the command
# vagrant with all args.
# If the install dir does not exist, then the vagrant command is made in the
# working directory from where you called this script
